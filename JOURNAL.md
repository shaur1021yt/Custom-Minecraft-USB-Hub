This is my journal of the design and building process of **Custom Minecraft USB Hub**.  
You can view this journal in more detail on **Hack Club Blueprint** [here](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/306).


## 10/8/2025 - I began routing the PCB for the USB hub.  

I started up a new project on EasyEDA and just thought to start making something that I need. Then I remembered seeing the HackClub USB hub jam and decided that as my first project I want to start off simple, just to learn the basics. 

So I began and it took longer than what it might take for others, but it took me about an hour to an hour and a half to do what the first part of the tutorial told me, plus adding one more USB segment.

This is how much I've been able to do.   

## 10/9/2025 - I realized I need to change more things...  

Okay so, I realized that I must add something else. So I'm going to add an LED to know what the USB hub is powered. I started researching how to incorporate that into my design and will try to ask blueprint support soon. I have basketball now so I gtg, but I'll be back. (mins of research to no avail)

Okay, I asked Chatgpt for how I can incorporate 1 LED into the USB hub to see if its working. But then I had the craziest idea. I'm not kidding, I might be the next Einstein or smth. So my idea is that in total I add four LED's:

> One LED to see whether the USB Hub is powered
> Three LED's for each USB connection to know which connections are powered and which are not

I'm so hyped right now... (30 mins doing research trying to figure out how this would work) 
Kinda Like this:

I will start incorporating in next journal :D.

 

  

## 10/10/2025 - Gonna Start with the LED's  

Alrighty, I'm back. 8:52am

Ok its 9:45am now and I've made some progress. I have taken forever, asking a bunch of people how to do it because I didn't understand it too much but now have been able to get one LED down. The main power led has been implemented!!!!! 

At least I hope it works. I will still keep on going. I need the other three LED's done today so I can start designing the PCB then finally doing the fun stuff. The 3d modelling for the case!
Back to work!

Its 9:51am, not too far forward than before but I just tried to do the 3 LED's. I will ask someone to check it but for now this is all I can do. I just winged it a little using my prior knowledge from what I have learnt with the first led. Ok wish me luck. Heres how it looks now.![Screenshot 2025-10-10 9.52.57 AM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTQ0MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--53ca034aca9231a6c78538b08446c0e0742ef2b0/Screenshot%202025-10-10%209.52.57%20AM.png)
  

## 10/13/2025 - Converted and Began Routing PCB  

5:11pm - I just converted my schematic to a pcb
![Screenshot 2025-10-13 5.12.35 PM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjExOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--430722ffa8aba4beacb6f653400c1d34dfb02ea1/Screenshot%202025-10-13%205.12.35%20PM.png)

Time to Route everything!!!!
Okay, its 5:58 now and this is why I've got! Just a few more ratlines remain. 
![Screenshot 2025-10-13 5.58.33 PM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjEzMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d2767a5569cb94a3237b2db5a6f62550f6ae7a2d/Screenshot%202025-10-13%205.58.33%20PM.png)

I think I got this. Oh and also, I found out why my PCB Hacker Card didn't work when I ordered it... I hadn't routed the wires and just left the rat lines as they were thinking they were wires. Uhm. So I just have like 5 PCB cards that do absolutely nothing. Um. If anyone knows how I could maybe solder the wires in or get a refund if possible. Reach out to me plz. I also learnt smth new now. I learnt how to implement the back of the PCB's for wiring. I was just tryna add wires at the back but now I understand I have to first use the "Via" part. Ok back to work. Gotta finish the rest of the ratlines by using the back. And GUESS who just learnt how? Exactly. Ok I'll be back once done.

Its 6:38Pm and I've finished Routing!!!!

Now tomorrow I will begin the cad and also before that I will also change the shape of the PCB for my custom Minecraft Hub holder. I have a few ideas and I will decide ASAP. That's it for today!
