This is my journal of the design and building process of **Custom Minecraft USB Hub**.  
You can view this journal in more detail on **Hack Club Blueprint** [here](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/306).


## 10/8/2025 - I began routing the PCB for the USB hub.  

I started up a new project on EasyEDA and just thought to start making something that I need. Then I remembered seeing the HackClub USB hub jam and decided that as my first project I want to start off simple, just to learn the basics. 

So I began and it took longer than what it might take for others, but it took me about an hour to an hour and a half to do what the first part of the tutorial told me, plus adding one more USB segment.

This is how much I've been able to do.   

## 10/9/2025 - I realized I need to change more things...  

Okay so, I realized that I must add something else. So I'm going to add an LED to know what the USB hub is powered. I started researching how to incorporate that into my design and will try to ask blueprint support soon. I have basketball now so I gtg, but I'll be back. (mins of research to no avail)

Okay, I asked Chatgpt for how I can incorporate 1 LED into the USB hub to see if its working. But then I had the craziest idea. I'm not kidding, I might be the next Einstein or smth. So my idea is that in total I add four LED's:

> One LED to see whether the USB Hub is powered
> Three LED's for each USB connection to know which connections are powered and which are not

I'm so hyped right now... (30 mins doing research trying to figure out how this would work) 
Kinda Like this:

I will start incorporating in next journal :D.
